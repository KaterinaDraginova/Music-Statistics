# Music-Statistics

 **MusicStatistic** is a relational database project that simulates a comprehensive music industry dataset, inspired by real-world scenarios and built using Microsoft SQL Server.

The project models the ecosystem of the global music industry, capturing data on artists, albums, tracks, tours, shows, venues, record labels, and more. From chart-topping albums to worldwide tours, this system provides a robust structure for storing and analyzing music-related information.

As the volume and complexity of music data grow, the industry needs systems capable of handling interconnected datasetsâ€”such as linking album sales with show performances or tracking artists by geography and genre.
## This database allows users to

- **Track** artist careers and discographies

- **Analyze** tour revenue and attendance
